      # bind-mounting these two files in will let you add packages during development without rebuilding
      # for example, to add bower to your app while developing, just install it inside the container
      # and then nodemon will restart. Your changes will last until you "docker-compose down" and will
      # be saved on host for next build
      # NOTE: this won't work on Docker Toolbox (virtualbox) which doesn't bind-mount single files
      # docker-compose exec node npm install --save bower
